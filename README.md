Homework 1

For this assignment, the class was asked to refractor code for Horiseon's website, in order to make it more accessible. Listed below are the changes I made.

HTML:
First off, I noticed the structure was a little messy, so I added space & indented the code to make it easier to read. 
I updated the title to be more specific to the company. 

I also noticed the lack of semantic HTML elements & tags. Too many divs. 
So, I replaced <div> with things like <header>, <nav>, <figure>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, & <footer>. 
In addition, I got rid of most of the classes because the semantic elements reduced the need for them. 

CSS:
Our CSS was a bit long and provided unnecessary code, so I updated it to fit my refractored HTML file.
Once I did that, I was able to do away with certain styles. I didn't delete them, just commented them out instead.
